# Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# = operator
"""
= (Assignment Operator): This operator is used to assign a value to a variable.
For example, x = 10 assigns the value 10 to the variable x


"""
# == operator
"""
== (Equality Operator): This operator is used to compare two values for equality.
It checks whether the values on both sides of the operator are equal and returns True if they are,
 or False if they are not. For example, x == 10 checks if x is equal to 10."""

# What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used

# What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
"""
^ operator is a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator. 
It performs a comparison of two numbers at the binary level, 
returning a new number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different, 
and 0 if they are the same.
